🌍 AI Travel Planner

AI Travel Planner is a web-based application that generates personalized travel itineraries using Large Language Models (LLMs). Built with Python and Streamlit, the application leverages the Hugging Face Inference API to create detailed, day-wise travel plans based on user input.

The system allows users to enter a travel query (for example, number of days and destination), and the AI instantly generates a well-structured travel plan including activities, sightseeing, and recommendations. The project follows best practices for API security by storing sensitive credentials in environment variables and excluding them from version control.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of LLM integration, API handling, secure deployment, and modern web app development using Streamlit.
